[Play the game](https://mirkoeffe.github.io/The-hunting-hyena/)

## Description

The hunting hyena game is a very simple game where the hyena must go on 1 minute hunt to feed itself as much as possible, but must pay attention to not get hunted by the lions. If the player runs out of lives or time will be brought to the end game screen where can either restart the game or go back to the homepage.

## Functionalities

- The hyena can be moved by `left`, `right`, `up` and `down` or `a`, `d`, `w` and `s`
- The game can be restarted by pressing `enter`
- The game can be paused by pressing `p`
- By clicking `backspace`, the game is reloaded and the player will go back to the home page
- Lions and Zebras appear on the right side of the screen at random position and random frequency
- Lions and Zebras disappear once they reach the left edge of the screen
- Score is automatically incremented depending on two factors: First, +2 points if the Hyena eats a Zebra, Second, +1 if a Lion reaches the left edge of the screen
- Lives are decremented automatically when the Lion eats the Hyena
- Once the time has elapsed or the player runs out of lives the game is over

## Backlog Functionalities

- Adding a third end game screen displayed only after reaching the maximum points (ca. 500 points)
- Adding a level system where obstacles are moving faster
- Leveling progress will give bonuses to the player
